        <h1>Numb</h1>
        <a>by Linkin Park</a><br>
        <a>
            I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
            Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface<br>
            Don't know what you're expecting of me<br>
            Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br><br>
            Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
            (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br><br>
            I've become so numb<br>
            I can't feel you there<br>
            Become so tired<br>
            So much more aware<br>
            I'm becoming this<br>
            All I want to do<br>
            Is be more like me<br>
            And be less like you<br><br>
            Can't you see that you're smothering me<br>
            Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?<br>
            'Cause everything that you thought I would be<br>
            Has fallen apart right in front of you<br>
